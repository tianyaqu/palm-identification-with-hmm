# palm-identification-with-hmm
an easy approach to demonstrate identify palm with Hidden Markov Model

## What and How
This implementation is inspired by the following two papers.

1. 基于奇异值分解和隐马尔可夫模型的掌纹识别技术研究,顾芳,西安理工大学;硕士毕业论文
2. DSW Feature Based Hidden Marcov Model: An Application on Object Identification Zheng Liang1, Wang Taiqing1, Wang Shengjin1 and Ding Xiaoqing1

It uses [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) Palmprint Database](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~biometrics/) as input images,so you will
at first obtain the palmprint database from PolyU's website.

After that,you may slightly edit the run.m,adjust the path to the palmprint directory,then print run in matlab to fire the engine.(I believe you 
have configured the matlab work path in advance).

You may make your own modification based on this project.Have fun!
